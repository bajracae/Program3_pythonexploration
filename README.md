# Program3_pythonexploration
- file name has to be "mypython.py"
- create 3 files
- each name differently
- each file has 10 random characters from the lowercase, no spaces
- 11th character is \n
- additional runs should not append into the files (clear it before every run)?
- execute, output sent to stdout should first print out the contents of the 3 files
- after printing the strings, print two random numbers 1 to 42 inclusive
- last line (6th) print out the product of the two numbers
